This is the research Blog of the Autonomous Vision Group at the MPI-IS and University of Tübingen 

Our group is co-located at the University of Tübingen and the MPI for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen. We are interested in computer vision and machine learning with a focus on 3D scene understanding, parsing, reconstruction, material and motion estimation for autonomous intelligent systems such as self-driving cars or household robots. In particular, we investigate how complex prior knowledge can be incorporated into computer vision algorithms for making them robust to variations in our complex 3D world. You can follow us on [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=SrVnrPcAAAAJ&hl=en) (paper email alert), on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/cvlibs) (video email alert) and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/andreas.geiger.395).
